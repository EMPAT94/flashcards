# Flashcards

Simple, Private, Secure... I created this flashcards app as a means for my own study. I'm sharing it with the hope that it will help you too.

## Structure

Imagine your knowledge as a tree. Any basic factoid that you know is part of a sub-field that belongs to a larger topic.

For example the fact that `Force = Mass * Acceleration` is your factoid belonging to the sub-field or sub-topic of `Classical Physics` which in-itself is a subset of a larger branch of science named `Physics`. While one can argue that there can be several more layers here, and it is true, I chose to keep a 3 layer heirarchy for both simplicity and ease of understanding.

So you have a Topic like `Physics` or `Mathematics` which include subtopics like `Quantum Physics` or `Probability` resp. These subtopics are the ones that actually hold all your flashcards.

If you've read ["What are flashcards?"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard), or already know 'em, they have a front and back -> Ideally, front for questions and back for answers.

Once you enter a subtopic, you can create as many flash cards as you want.

## Working

The app leverages your browsers' built in database for storing all your data. This means there is no  transfer of data - all your data is your own. This also means that the app can work fully offline, once you've loaded the site.

## Upcoming

Backup and restore functionality

## Known Issues

let me know :)
